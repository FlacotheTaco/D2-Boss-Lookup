              Before the boss fight starts, assign one person two do the mechanics of the fight. The other five people will jump off the edge and kill themselves before the encounter starts.
              When the person who is doing the mechanics gets teleported, the other five people will respawn and call out the oracle spawns. When the mechanic has been finished, damage to Atheon will begin.
              Gather at one of the portals and deal enough damage to Atheon to kill him.
            </p>

            <h1> Loadout Recommendations </h1>
            <p> 
              It's also recommded to have someone run a debuff weapon like Tractor Cannon and another person using Gjallarhorn to increase damage output.
              The other guardians should run a combination of rocket launches, high damage special weapons, and single hit supers.
              A loadout like Izanagi's Burden, Apex Predator, and a single hit super like Celestial Nighthawk Golden Gun will help to deal high damage to Kalli.
              Surge mods along with time dialation are also recommded for maximizing damage output. 
              There should also be several Warlocks using Well of Radiance for the survivability of the team.
